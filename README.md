# Showerthoughts
Pwnagotchi plugin - Display random shower thoughts rss headlines when waiting.

Save showerthoughts.py to your plugins directory

add the following to your config.toml

main.plugins.showerthoughts.enable = true
main.plugins.showerthoughts.rss_url = "https://www.reddit.com/r/showerthoughts.rss"
main.plugins.showerthoughts.saved_rss = "/root/showerthoughts.rss"

this code is untested but I wanted it to get out there to see if the community could find and fix and issues
